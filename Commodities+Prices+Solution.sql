Algorithm:
Input: price_details: Id, Region_Id, Commodity_Id, Date and Retail_Price; commodities_info: Id and Commodity
Expected Output: Commodity | price difference;  Retain the info for highest difference
Step 1: Filter Jun 2020 in Date column of price_details
Step 2: Aggregation – MIN(retail_price), MAX(retail_price) group by commodity
Step 3: Compute the difference between the Max and Min retail price
Step 4: Sort in descending order of price difference; Retain the top most row

Step 1: Aggregation – COUNT(DISTINCT variety), group by Commodity
Step 2: Sort the final table in descending order of Variety count

Which commodity has the highest number of data points available?

Algorithm:
Input: price_details: Id, region_id, commodity_id region_info: Id and State commodities_info: Id and Commodity
Expected Output: commodity;  Expecting only one value as output
Step 1: Join region info and price details using the Region_Id from price_details with Id from region_info
Step 2: From result of Step 1, perform aggregation – COUNT(Id), group by State; 
Step 3: Sort the result based on the record count computed in Step 2 in ascending order;

Step 4: Filter for the state identified from Step 3 from the price_details table
Step 5: Aggregation – COUNT(Id), group by commodity_id; Sort in descending order of count 
Step 6: Filter for top 1 value and join with commodities_info to get the commodity name

Question 5: What is the price variation of commodities for each city from Jan 2019 to Dec 2020.

Algorithm:
Input: price_details: Id, region_id, commodity_id, date, retail_price 
	   region_info: Id and City 
	   commodities_info: Id and Commodity
Expected Output: Commodity | city | Start Price | End Price | Variation absolute | Variation Percentage;  
Sort in descending order of variation %

Step 1: Filter for Jan 2019 from Date column of the price_details table
Step 2: Filter for Dec 2020 from Date column of the price_details table
Step 3: Do an inner join between the results from Step 1 and Step 2 on region_id and commodity id
Step 4: Name the price from Step 1 result as Start Price and Step 2 result as End Price
Step 5: Calculate Variations in absolute and percentage; 
		Sort the final table in descending order of Variation Percentage
Step 6: Filter for 1st record and join with region_info, commodities_info to get city and commodity name
